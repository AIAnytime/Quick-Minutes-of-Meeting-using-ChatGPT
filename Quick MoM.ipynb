I call it alibaba intelligence. Yeah. Might end up being true, you never know. Um, fairly getting any information out, basically with speech. Yeah, I'm always amazed by the, what you're vision about the technology. I'm not a tech guy. I think I'm all about life. I think AI is going to open a new chapter of the society of the world that people try to understand ourself better, rather than the outside world. And it's so difficult to predict the future. 99.99% of the predictions that human being had in history about the future are wrong. Including that one? Oh, yeah. Only, you know, the zero point, zero zero percent of the prediction are right. They're right because by accident. Yeah, but it's also true that 80% of statistics are false. Yeah. So my meaning is... Cold room. Come on, guys. It was a joke. My name is, I'm happy about the, people worry a lot about this today. Are those people, I called them, called, um, uh, called college smarteners? People like us, street smart. We never scared of that. We, we think it's a great fun and we want to change ourself to embrace it. I don't know, man. That's like famous last words. This is, let me tell you, like you couldn't evolve Silicon circuits. You needed to be a biology to get there. Good. Yeah. Well, let's talk about something fun. What do you think about that? Actually, I'm not interested in a Mars. I just came back from there, so... I'm more interested in the Earth. The things, what's going on happening here? So, why are you so curious about the Mars? Just a one step ago to Mars, but you would never be able to come back. Yeah. Well, that's my view. That's not works though. And, uh, also, also... Don't do it. I hate to go to Himalayas too. I mean, when you climb on the, I think someday I would go there when the elevator's ready. I would go there and look. But, well, that's my view about jobs. Don't worry about it. You will have jobs. Yeah. I, I, I... I, I, I, I think, I think of like technology, like technology and technology awareness. There's like, it's like, if there was like a topological map of technology awareness, it's mostly flat, with a few short buildings and then some very toll spires, very toll spires. And unless you're on that very toll spire, it's not obvious what the topology is. Yeah. I never worry about the things that I cannot solve. I let other people to solve it. If nobody can solve it, just let it be. That's my life. Oh, let's talk about education. I'm quite interested in about education. Computer only have chips. Man have the heart. It's the heart where the wisdom comes from. So, I think that's my view. And don't worry about it. We will change it. Yeah. Okay, let's go. So, I never, in my life, and especially last two years when people talk about AI, say, human, human being will be controlled by machines. I never think about that. I think it's, it's, it's, it's impossible. Right? It's impossible. Because, because human beings, they are different. Machines are invented by human beings. And according to the science, right, humans can never create another animal that is smart and human. Especially when you have so many smart people, it's impossible to make another smart people. I very much disagree with that. Okay. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. My view is that, um, computer may be clever, but human being are much smarter. Yeah, definitely not. Clever is very academic. So, I told those guys, they are very sad. So, uh, computer will be smarter than human beings because computer can play chess better. Uh, I think you have stupid to compete with that. Don't do that. So, this is, this is, we always do things we are good at. Sure. Okay. Well, what would be an example of something that humans are better than a computer at? And, and then let's see if that happens. Well, humans, computer is only one of the collaborative tools that human created. And computers are a clever, but there will be more tools that human beings will create. It's much clever than computers. That's my view. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right? In the future, if you want to survive in this world, you have to be the LQ, the Q of love. That's important too. Otherwise, you can survive in that efficient talent. It's time. Yeah. But I agree with love is the answer. Yeah.

I call it alibaba intelligence. Yeah. Might end up being true, you never know. Um, fairly getting any information out, basically with speech. Yeah, I'm always amazed by the, what you're vision about the technology. I'm not a tech guy. I think I'm all about life. I think AI is going to open a new chapter of the society of the world that people try to understand ourself better, rather than the outside world. And it's so difficult to predict the future. 99.99% of the predictions that human being had in history about the future are wrong. Including that one? Oh, yeah. Only, you know, the zero point, zero zero percent of the prediction are right. They're right because by accident. Yeah, but it's also true that 80% of statistics are false. Yeah. So my meaning is... Cold room. Come on, guys. It was a joke. My name is, I'm happy about the, people worry a lot about this today. Are those people, I called them, called, um, uh, called college smarteners? People like us, street smart. We never scared of that. We, we think it's a great fun and we want to change ourself to embrace it. I don't know, man. That's like famous last words. This is, let me tell you, like you couldn't evolve Silicon circuits. You needed to be a biology to get there. Good. Yeah. Well, let's talk about something fun. What do you think about that? Actually, I'm not interested in a Mars. I just came back from there, so... I'm more interested in the Earth. The things, what's going on happening here? So, why are you so curious about the Mars? Just a one step ago to Mars, but you would never be able to come back. Yeah. Well, that's my view. That's not works though. And, uh, also, also... Don't do it. I hate to go to Himalayas too. I mean, when you climb on the, I think someday I would go there when the elevator's ready. I would go there and look. But, well, that's my view about jobs. Don't worry about it. You will have jobs. Yeah. I, I, I... I, I, I, I think, I think of like technology, like technology and technology awareness. There's like, it's like, if there was like a topological map of technology awareness, it's mostly flat, with a few short buildings and then some very toll spires, very toll spires. And unless you're on that very toll spire, it's not obvious what the topology is. Yeah. I never worry about the things that I cannot solve. I let other people to solve it. If nobody can solve it, just let it be. That's my life. Oh, let's talk about education. I'm quite interested in about education. Computer only have chips. Man have the heart. It's the heart where the wisdom comes from. So, I think that's my view. And don't worry about it. We will change it. Yeah. Okay, let's go. So, I never, in my life, and especially last two years when people talk about AI, say, human, human being will be controlled by machines. I never think about that. I think it's, it's, it's, it's impossible. Right? It's impossible. Because, because human beings, they are different. Machines are invented by human beings. And according to the science, right, humans can never create another animal that is smart and human. Especially when you have so many smart people, it's impossible to make another smart people.
